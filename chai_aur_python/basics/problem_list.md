## ðŸ§© Slightly More Challenging (Still Medium Level)

21. **Write a function that flattens a nested list.**
    Example: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` â†’ `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

22. **Rotate a list to the right by `k` steps.**
    Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 2` â†’ `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`

23. **Find common elements between two lists.**

24. **Check if a list is a palindrome.**
    Example: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` â†’ `True`

25. **Write a program to split a list into two halves.**

26. **Group adjacent duplicates together.**
    Example: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` â†’ `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3]]`

27. **Sum all elements in a list without using `sum()`.**

28. **Find the frequency of each element using a dictionary.**

29. **Print all pairs in a list whose sum is equal to a target.**
    Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, target = 5 â†’ `(1, 4), (2, 3)`

30. **Create a 2D list (matrix) and access its elements.**
